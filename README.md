# Feminist Development Cooperation – Data Pipeline (Master Thesis)

This repository contains the data cleaning and analysis code for my thesis 
examining whether feminist development cooperation projects (specifically
those that address gender norms) in Liberia are associated with lower 
acceptance of intimate partner violence among women. The full thesis is 
available via the Hertie School Library.
